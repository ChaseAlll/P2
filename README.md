## FAQ
 * Are there any performance settings that need changed?
   * New versions of Dolphin come with the most optimized settings preselected. If you are having trouble, try lowering the resolution or choosing a different renderer in the graphics settings under the options toolbar. 
 * "This application has failed to start because XINPUT1_3.dll was not found"
   * This only occurs on systems using an older version of Windows (below 10). Like how we installed the VS C++ redistributable install the Latest DirectX Runtime from [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/179113/how-to-install-the-latest-version-of-directx) 
 * “Im using a PS3/4 controller and it is not recognized.”
   * Install the SCPToolkit from [here](https://github.com/nefarius/ScpToolkit) this will allow windows to recognize the controller as a Bluetooth device and retry adding the controller.
